It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin' from within
I grip tha cannon like Fanon and pass tha shells to my classmates
Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
He stakes all his silver on a promise to be free
Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings, I have brought some dreams to share
There's a shadow just behind me shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty, pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler who upon the finger rests
Tha sun ablaze as Maria's foot touches tha surface of sand
On northern land as human contraband
She stuffed ten to a truckbed, she clutches her cross
Here comes tha exhaust and it rips through her lungs
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots and then came the shot
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
We are stardust, we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden
By the time we got to Woodstock we were half a million strong
They were turning into butterflies above our nation

There's a good reason why nobody studies history, it just teaches you too much
The indoctrination is so deep that educated people think they're being objective
We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them
The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once
